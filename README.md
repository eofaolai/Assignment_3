# Assignment_3

For this assignment we will make use of the data scraped for the web scraper assignment. Go to the Discussions board and download 10 sets of generated data locally on to your machine.

For the first part we will need to clean the data and put it into a standard form. (You can choose the standard form.) To do this you will need to write a python script that loads a specific file downloaded from the Discussions board. For the second part you will need to provide a script which loads the merged file and sorts the companies from best to worst in terms of sentiment of their purpose.

Submit to me the URL of the git project (remember to make a new git project for this), the top 10 companies, the bottom 10 companies and any additional insight you might have gotten about the data from this analysis.
